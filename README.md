# Argo AI Data Pipeline

A robust, cloud-native data pipeline that automatically ingests Argo float data from `.nc` files, processes it, and stores it in a persistent, searchable vector database. The entire pipeline is served via a Flask API and deployed on Microsoft Azure.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Data Ingestion:** Upload `.nc` files via a simple API endpoint.
- **Robust Processing:** Intelligently handles different data formats (e.g., `JULD` vs. `timestamp`) and gracefully skips corrupted files or malformed data rows without crashing.
- **Vectorization:** Converts scientific data into natural language sentences and stores them as vector embeddings using `sentence-transformers`.
- **Persistent Storage:** Utilizes a persistent ChromaDB vector store, ensuring data is safe across application restarts.
- **Deduplication:** Automatically checks for and ignores duplicate data records, keeping the database clean and efficient.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Containerized with Docker and deployed on Azure App Service for high availability and scalability.
